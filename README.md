In this project, I will attempt to show you how to create a basic MERN (MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js) Stack application. In order to run the project download it and open with any code editor(my preference is Visual Studio)
Then run the below command in sequence.

1. git clone https://github.com/santos-parajuli/portfolio // download git repository
2. npm install // Install dependencies for REACT
3. npm start // run REACT

In REACT, I used MaterialUI for building components.

I will also be deploying this project live on my website www.siwani.com.np so you can check it out there.
HAPPY HACKING !!!
